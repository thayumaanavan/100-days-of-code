# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Forked Rasa_nlu project. Exported my sample data from LUIS and trained and tested using rasa_nlu's sklearn+spacy backend.

**Thoughts:** Rasa_nlu Project has been updated since it got released.Many contributions are happening.Hope I will do some :)
